          Electronic trading systems, R&D • Delphi, gRPC
            - Enabled the integration of a legacy authentication system with recent technologies,

              three juniors in the design of a Protobuf-based protocol, collaborating via UML diagrams.
            - Allowed two large customers to send user account communications with a reasonable
              delay of 3s and zero failure rate, by designing and implementing a mail merge solution.
